# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
This is a simplified clone of Airbnb designed as a learning project to explore backend development principles. The goal is to simulate key features of a rental platform, such as property listings, user accounts, bookings, and reviews, while applying real-world backend practices.

## Project Goals
- Understand the structure of a real-world backend system.
- Practice building RESTful APIs with authentication and data validation.
- Gain hands-on experience with database modeling and deployment.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Framework:** FastAPI or Django (to be finalized)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
- **Deployment:** Docker, Render or Heroku (future phases)

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for implementing the server-side logic of the application, including creating APIs, handling business logic, and ensuring secure and scalable communication between the client and database.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the database system. Ensures data integrity, performance optimization, and implements backup and recovery strategies.

### DevOps Engineer
Sets up and maintains the infrastructure required to deploy and monitor the application. Automates workflows using CI/CD pipelines and ensures system reliability and scalability.

### Project Manager
Coordinates the team, defines the project timeline, assigns tasks, and ensures that milestones are met. Serves as a communication bridge between developers and stakeholders.

### Quality Assurance (QA) Tester
Writes and runs tests to ensure the application functions as expected. Detects bugs early and works closely with the team to resolve issues before deployment.

### UI/UX Designer *(Optional role in some teams)*
Designs user-friendly interfaces and ensures a smooth user experience. Collaborates with frontend and backend developers to bring visual and functional consistency to the app.

## Technology Stack

### Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build scalable and secure web applications quickly. It provides built-in support for creating RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework (DRF).

### PostgreSQL
A powerful open-source relational database used to store and manage structured data such as users, listings, and bookings in the Airbnb clone.

### GraphQL *(if used in your project)*
A query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need. It improves performance and flexibility in client-server communication.

### Docker
Used for containerizing the application to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments. It simplifies deployment and scalability.

### Git & GitHub
Version control tools that help track changes in the codebase, manage collaboration across the team, and host the project repository online.

### Render or Heroku *(Deployment platform; choose based on your actual project)*
Used to deploy the web application online, making it accessible to users for testing and demonstration.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. It supports both guests (who book properties) and hosts (who list properties), using role-based access control.

### Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each property includes details such as title, location, description, price per night, and availability status.

### Booking System
Guests can search for properties, view availability, and make bookings for selected dates. The system handles conflict checks to prevent double-bookings and manages booking statuses.

### Review and Rating System
After a completed stay, guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties. This helps build trust and transparency between guests and hosts.

### Payment Integration
Handles secure payment processing for bookings. Payments are recorded with details such as amount, date, and status, ensuring a clear transaction history for users and admins.

### Admin Dashboard *(Optional/Future Enhancement)*
Provides administrative users with tools to monitor user activity, view system analytics, and manage content. It helps maintain platform quality and enforce community guidelines.
