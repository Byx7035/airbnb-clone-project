# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
This is a simplified clone of Airbnb designed as a learning project to explore backend development principles. The goal is to simulate key features of a rental platform, such as property listings, user accounts, bookings, and reviews, while applying real-world backend practices.

## Project Goals
- Understand the structure of a real-world backend system.
- Practice building RESTful APIs with authentication and data validation.
- Gain hands-on experience with database modeling and deployment.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Framework:** FastAPI or Django (to be finalized)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
- **Deployment:** Docker, Render or Heroku (future phases)

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for implementing the server-side logic of the application, including creating APIs, handling business logic, and ensuring secure and scalable communication between the client and database.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the database system. Ensures data integrity, performance optimization, and implements backup and recovery strategies.

### DevOps Engineer
Sets up and maintains the infrastructure required to deploy and monitor the application. Automates workflows using CI/CD pipelines and ensures system reliability and scalability.

### Project Manager
Coordinates the team, defines the project timeline, assigns tasks, and ensures that milestones are met. Serves as a communication bridge between developers and stakeholders.

### Quality Assurance (QA) Tester
Writes and runs tests to ensure the application functions as expected. Detects bugs early and works closely with the team to resolve issues before deployment.

### UI/UX Designer *(Optional role in some teams)*
Designs user-friendly interfaces and ensures a smooth user experience. Collaborates with frontend and backend developers to bring visual and functional consistency to the app.

## Technology Stack

### Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build scalable and secure web applications quickly. It provides built-in support for creating RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework (DRF).

### PostgreSQL
A powerful open-source relational database used to store and manage structured data such as users, listings, and bookings in the Airbnb clone.

### GraphQL *(if used in your project)*
A query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need. It improves performance and flexibility in client-server communication.

### Docker
Used for containerizing the application to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments. It simplifies deployment and scalability.

### Git & GitHub
Version control tools that help track changes in the codebase, manage collaboration across the team, and host the project repository online.

### Render or Heroku *(Deployment platform; choose based on your actual project)*
Used to deploy the web application online, making it accessible to users for testing and demonstration.

## Database Design

### Entities and Fields

#### 1. Users
- `id`: Unique identifier for each user
- `name`: Full name of the user
- `email`: Email address (used for login)
- `password_hash`: Encrypted password
- `role`: Can be "host" or "guest"

#### 2. Properties
- `id`: Unique identifier for each property
- `title`: Name or description of the listing
- `location`: City or geographic location
- `price_per_night`: Cost to rent per night
- `host_id`: Foreign key linking to the user who owns the property

#### 3. Bookings
- `id`: Unique booking identifier
- `property_id`: Foreign key linking to the booked property
- `guest_id`: Foreign key linking to the user who made the booking
- `check_in`: Start date of the stay
- `check_out`: End date of the stay

#### 4. Reviews
- `id`: Unique review identifier
- `property_id`: Foreign key linking to the reviewed property
- `guest_id`: Foreign key linking to the reviewer
- `rating`: Star rating (1â€“5)
- `comment`: Textual feedback

#### 5. Payments
- `id`: Unique payment transaction ID
- `booking_id`: Foreign key linking to the booking
- `amount`: Total amount paid
- `payment_date`: Timestamp of payment
- `status`: Payment status (e.g., successful, failed)

### Entity Relationships

- A **User** can be a **host** (owning multiple properties) or a **guest** (making bookings).
- A **Property** is owned by one user (host) and can have multiple bookings and reviews.
- A **Booking** is linked to one guest and one property.
- A **Review** is written by a guest and linked to a specific property.
- A **Payment** is tied to a single booking.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. It supports both guests (who book properties) and hosts (who list properties), using role-based access control.

### Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each property includes details such as title, location, description, price per night, and availability status.

### Booking System
Guests can search for properties, view availability, and make bookings for selected dates. The system handles conflict checks to prevent double-bookings and manages booking statuses.

### Review and Rating System
After a completed stay, guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties. This helps build trust and transparency between guests and hosts.

### Payment Integration
Handles secure payment processing for bookings. Payments are recorded with details such as amount, date, and status, ensuring a clear transaction history for users and admins.

### Admin Dashboard *(Optional/Future Enhancement)*
Provides administrative users with tools to monitor user activity, view system analytics, and manage content. It helps maintain platform quality and enforce community guidelines.

## API Security

Securing the backend API is critical to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the integrity of the platform. This project will implement the following key security measures:

### 1. Authentication
Only registered users will be able to access protected routes. This will be handled using token-based authentication such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens), which securely identifies and validates each user session.

*Why it's important:* Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and protects personal data.

### 2. Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to define what actions different users can perform. For example, only hosts can create property listings, and only guests can make bookings.

*Why it's important:* Ensures that users can only perform actions they are permitted to, protecting platform integrity.

### 3. Rate Limiting
Requests to the API will be rate-limited to prevent abuse, such as brute-force attacks or spamming endpoints.

*Why it's important:* Helps mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and protects server resources.

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection or XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

*Why it's important:* Prevents malicious users from compromising the system or extracting sensitive information.

### 5. Secure Payment Handling
Payments will be processed using a secure third-party provider (e.g., Stripe), with sensitive data like credit card numbers never stored on the server.

*Why it's important:* Protects financial data and builds trust with users.
